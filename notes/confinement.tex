\section*{Introduction}

The study of water in its many forms has always been an area of great interest for a range of scientific studies, due to its ubiquity and unique long-range structure and properties. In contrast to water in a bulk environment, water in a confined environment exhibits drastically different structural and dynamic properties. Water in nanoconfinement is already found in a variety of applications including biology \cite{Chaban2011,Schneider2010} and geology \cite{Brown2001} and enhanced properties make it a promising tool for applications such as energy conversion \cite{Dhiman2011,Siria2013} and microfluidics \cite{Prakash2008}.

Theoretical studies have reported the presence of ice structures in nanoconfined 2-dimensional water\cite{Zangi2003,Zangi2003_2}, and this observation has been supported by microscopy \cite{Algara-Siller2015} and crystallography results showing enhanced order of water at hydrophobic interfaces. Additionally, in nanotubes, which are generally assumed to reduce the dimensionality of the confined solvent to one, it has been seen that an ice monolayer sheet can form which mimics the cylindrical nature of the confining tube \cite{Maniwa2005}. Graphene is chosen as an idealized hydrophobic confining media, 

\clearpage

\textbf{\color{red} Ordered phases of water (e.g. ice or layered structures) form under planar hydrophobic confinement when the confinement length scale is commensurate with the amount of water confined. For rigid confining surfaces at incommensurate confinement distances, disordered phases from instead. Many of the studies use as confining surfaces graphene sheets modeled as rigid layers due to its great technologically relevance. However, graphene is in reality a highly flexible material, even at the scale of the MD simulations. Here, we show that the disordered phases at incommensurate confinement distances previously observed exist only because of the artificial stabilization of the rigid confining surfaces. When the physical model of graphene is improved by explicitly modeling the bending degrees of freedom, we show that, for incommensurate distances, the system reorganizes (i.e. the graphene bends) to accommodate patchy ordered phases of water. Interestingly, the disordered phase can be recovered upon increasing the temperature from ambient to Tc, where Tc depends on the confinement length scale. Our findings suggest that the bending rigidity of the confining surfaces can be used, instead of temperature, to access different ordered/disordered phases of water. In this paper, we generalize the phase diagram of water nanoconfined under graphene monolayers, and show that some of the phases previously thought to be stable are just so under infinitely rigid confinement surfaces.
I think the intro should have just the specific information of what is known and has been done necessary to understand our findings and the novelty of the study. What I mean is that it should be less like "paper A did B, in paper C they found D, etc." and more like "water under subnanometer confinement forms ice (Ref A-B). For larger confinement distances it forms layered structures (Ref C-D). This is however not observed under hydrophilic confinement (Ref E), etc.". Each paragraph should be answering a concrete issue. Here are some points that I think the intro should address (these are not just lacking in your intro, you have covered major parts of them already): } \\ 

\textbf{\color{red} 1)	What is this paper about from broad to narrow scope? At the broader scale the paper is about water under nanoconfinement. We shouldn't mention applications or papers looking at microscale confinement or confinement in general, just water nanoconfinement is important enough. Going a bit narrower, we deal with planar hydrophobic confinement. We should emphasize the importance of planar hydrophobic confinement (vs. hydrophilic or confinement in nanotubes). Finally, our paper is about the importance of modeling graphene accurately (as flexible layers), so we also need to make a point regarding the technologically/scientifically relevance of the graphene-water system in particular. For example: "Water under nanoconfinement is important because…, and displays exotic properties such as…. In particular, planar hydrophobic confinement has promising applications for…. One of the easiest/best ways of achieving planar hydrophobic confinement is using graphene…."} \\

\textbf{\color{red} 2)	How does water under hydrophobic planar confinement looks like? This is the main point of the intro. You can mention a sentence or two on carbon nanotubes, but I would focus on planar confinement. Also, I would include papers where they don't look at graphene specifically, but idealized confining surfaces as well.} \\

\textbf{\color{red} a.	What are the ordered phases of water previously observed as a function of the confinement length scale?} \\

\textbf{\color{red} b.	When talking about the layering, we need to define well what we mean with commensurate distances, e.g. how many water molecules per unit surface area you need to form layers.}\\

\textbf{\color{red} c.	We need to comment briefly on the differences between hydrophobic and hydrophilic planar confinement. E.g. are the same ice structures observed? It's fine if they are not, but we need to be clear that we are looking only at hydrophobic confinement.}\\

\textbf{\color{red} 3)	That graphene is highly flexible is not controversial, so I wouldn't spend too much time citing papers regarding the applications of crumpled graphene, or the that 2D materials were thought to be theoretically unstable 60 years ago. Here we don't really harness that feature to achieve functionality. However, people usually model it rigid even though the computational expenses are minimal, we need to answer why. We want to make the point that graphene is in reality flexible even at the small length scale of the MD simulations. We need to be specific and give actual estimates from the literature of the magnitude of the out-of-plane fluctuations and the wavelength of the undulations. We need to prove that bending flexibility is important even for the "small" graphene sheets simulated (~ 5 nm).}\\

\textbf{\color{red} Finally, we need to assess very well what is known and has been observed under flexible planar confinement. After reading the last paragraph of the intro, it is clear that there are differences between rigid and flexible confinement (because you explicitly say so) but it's not clear what those differences actually are or how big, and that is the important point. I feel like the differences that they observed in that paper are pretty minor because the graphene layers are finite sized and water can go in-and-out the interlayer space easily. Check out the SI in the paper "Square ice in graphene nanocapillaries". They do some modeling that is actually much more relevant to our study than Ref 24.}

\section*{Introduction}

The study of water in its many forms has always been an area of great interest for a range of scientific studies, due to its ubiquity and unique long-range structure and properties. In contrast to water in a bulk environment, water in a confined environment exhibits drastically different structural and dynamic properties. Although it may not immediately be apparent, water in a confined form is just as ubiquitous as that in bulk, from biological systems (cell interiors, and membrane pores and channels), as well as industrial systems (presence of moisture in instruments). Thus, the characterization of water in confinement has recently become a growing field field with applications in a variety of domains, including biological applications \cite{Chaban2011,Schneider2010}, microfluidics \cite{Prakash2008} and energy conversion \cite{Dhiman2011,Siria2013}.

The introduction of hydrophobic walls immediately alters the structure of water by introducing anisotropy. Additionally, the form of these walls, e.g. in parallel walls or nanosized tubes, reduces the dimensionality of the system, to 2D and 1D, respectively. The effect of the hydrophobic confinement is generally analyzed by a characteristic length scale, such as plate separation for lamellar systems, and pore diameter for nanotubes. With larger length scales, the systems are typically divided into a core-shell or two-state model \cite{Korb1994, Liu1991}, which considers two different regions of confined water - those in the core are far enough from the wall that they behave like bulk water and those in the shell, whose properties are affected by the presence of the wall. Confined solute properties and experimental results can then be interpreted as a linear combination of these two regions. Recently  \cite{Laage2012}, the validity of this approximation has been examined, and it is also evident that this model is not valid at length scales commensurate with the size of water solvation shells. 

At the smaller length scales, all confined water is affected by the presence of an interface. Structurally at the smallest confinement lengths, water adapts ice-like structures, both in carbon nanotubes (CNT) and lamelllar graphene. In the carbon nanotubes, it has been seen that the ice monolayer mimics the cylindrical nature of the CNT, through x-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) studies \cite{Maniwa2005}. In graphene sheets, ice has been seen in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) \cite{Algara-Siller2015} as well as MD simulations of monolayers and bilayers of water \cite{Zangi2003,Zangi2003_2}.

Computational studies of confined water generally use a rigid model of graphene, but studies of isolated graphene sheets and other 2D nanomaterials reveal that these surfaces exhibit wrinkles and ripples  \cite{Fasolino2007, Los2009, Gao2014}. Mermin-Wagner theorem \cite{Mermin1968} states that long-wavelength fluctuations should destroy the order of 2D crystals, yet experiments have shown \cite{Meyer2007} that freely suspended graphene sheets do exist with high degrees of microscopic roughening (variations in the surface normal and out-of-plane deformations of up to 10 \r A).

The thermal basis for rippling is the anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes, whereas mechanical whereas mechanical factors, such as edges and impurities are other sources of rippling. Computational efforts have been made to characterize the rippling of the graphene with estimations of bending rigidity and stiffness parameters \cite{Wei2012}, graphene sheets have been characterized with the continuum medium theory and normal-normal correlation functions have been fit with power-laws \cite{Los2009}. The length of the ripples has been reported to be on the order of 80 \r A \cite{Fasolino2007, Los2009}, which is also important because of its commensurability with many simulation domain sizes.

Beyond characterizing intrinsic ripples and wrinkles in graphene, efforts have been made to report the temperature dependence of ripples (disappeared when systems heated to 450-600K, reappeared with cooling), create and manipulate these ripples (thermal induced compression) \cite{Bao2009}. Ripples also have applications in domains of graphene electronics (the sp\textsubscript{2}-to-sp\textsubscript{3} bandgap creation at selective locations), the enhanced diffusion of droplets on rippled sheets for enhanced, controlled nanoparticle transport \cite{Ma2016}. Wrinkled and crumpled graphene may have use in applications such as energy storage and strain sensing \cite{Deng2016}, cooling devices \cite{Warzoha2014} and pollutant adsorption and removal \cite{Wang2016}.

Understanding the nature of flexibility and rippling is important for the formation of graphene from graphite, where a single layer of graphene is removed using liquid as a media. During this process, a common issue is the reaggregation of graphene sheets, so dynamic interactions need to be better understood. To our knowledge, only one study \cite{Deshmukh2014} has explored the effect of graphene flexibility on confined water, and for their analysis, finite graphene sheets were used. Comparing rigid and flexible, finite graphene sheets in larger water boxes, they found that the systems behaved differently as a function of decreasing plate separation. For rigid sheets, there was a monotonic increase of local ordering of the confined water, whereas for the flexible graphene, the increase in ordering was non-monotonic. Differences  in water properties between rigid and flexible graphene models were most apparent at the smallest plate separation (8 \r A), and were observed in structural properties such as density profiles and radial distribution functions as well as dynamic observables such as mean square displacements and vibrational spectra.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Models}

For this study, simulations of systems with parallel graphene plates with
separations of 6 and 12 \r A respectively in the x-cartesian dimension.
Systems of two different sizes were used to explore periodic size effects, with graphene
plate separation held constant. The smaller systems had y-z dimensions of 46.2 by 48.5 \r A
and the large systems had dimensions of 121.8 by 118.8 \r A.

\textbf{\color{red} How were they built?? }

\subsection*{Force fields}

Harmonic bond and angle potentials were applied to the graphene sheets with 
the following parameters: k\textsubscript{bond} = 938.0 \(kCal/mol/\angstrom^2\)
and k\textsubscript{angle} = 126.0 \(kCal/mol/rad^2\), equilibrium bond and 
angle lengths of 1.40 \r A and 120.0 degrees respectively \cite{Hummer2001}. The
dihedral potential is harmonic with the functional form: \(E_{\text{di}} = K_{\text{di}} [ 1 + d cos(\phi)]\),
where K\textsubscript{di} = 3.15 kCal/mol, \(\phi = 180.0\) degrees and \(d = \pm 1\) \cite{Patra2009}. An improper torsional 
potential with a harmonic functional form as follows: \( E_{\text{im}} = K_{\text{im}} [ \chi - \chi_0 ]^2\) was
used with parameters K\textsubscript{im} =  15.0 kCal/mol and \(\chi_0 = 0.0\) degrees. A summary
of these potentials and their parameter values are given in Table \ref{table:ff_parms}
The water model chosen is TIP4P-Ew \cite{Horn2004} was used 
to represent explicit solvent. Partial charges and Van der Waals parameters for each atom type 
are given in Table \ref{table:ff_parms_atoms}.

\subsection*{Simulation protocols}

Simulations were performed with the LAMMPS software package \cite{Plimpton1995}. 
Equilibration of initial configurations were performed as follows. Systems were run in 
the NVE ensemble with a Langevin Thermostat at 298 Kelvin
for 10 ps. The water was then fixed with the SHAKE protocol \cite{Andersen1983} with a tolerance
of 10\textsuperscript{-4} and the system was run for 10 ps in the NVT ensemble.
Finally, data was saved for analysis in a production run in the NpT ensemble,
during which all cartesian coordinates were stored every 500 timesteps. 
Systems were run in the NpT ensemble for 10 ns. The 
pressure in the direction orthogonal to the graphene walls was maintained at 1 atm.
Thermal and pressure control were implemented using a Nos\' e-Hoover 
extended Lagrangian procedure \cite{Martyna1994} with characteristic damping times of 100 
and 1000 fs (0.1 and 1.0 ps), respectively. The dynamical integration 
scheme was velocity-Verlet \cite{Swope1982}.
For all simulations, the dynamics timestep was set at 2.0 femtoseconds. 

\subsection*{Analysis}

\subsubsection*{Energy calculations}

The excess Gibbs free energy (G\textsubscript{excess}) of the confined water was calculated as the sum of the excess enthalpy (H\textsubscript{excess}) and the excess entropy (S\textsubscript{excess}) as follows:
\begin{equation}
    G\textsubscript{excess}  =  H_{\text{excess}} - T  S_{\text{excess}}
\end{equation}

Where is H\textsubscript{excess} defined as \textbf{\color{red}this is from \cite{Huggins2012}}. 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\text{excess}} = E_{\text{interaction}} - RT
\end{equation}

Where E\textsubscript{excess} is computed from long-range and pair interactions. Bonded energetics (bond stretching, angle bending) are not included because the water mode is rigid. Calculations of the excess entropy are detailed in the next section and have been taken from the method detailed by Huggins \cite{Huggins2012}.

\subsubsection*{Entropy calculations}

The molecular pair correlation function in water is a function of five angles and the intermolecular separation, as depicted in Figure \textbf{\color{red}OMG figure}. Using the pair correlation function, the excess entropy can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{excess}} = - \frac{1}{2} k_B \rho \int_V [ g(r, \omega) ln \, g(r, \omega) - g(r, \omega) + 1 ] d \mathbf{r} \, d\omega
\end{equation}
Where k\textsubscript{B} is Boltzmann's constant, \(\rho\) is the number density of bulk water and \(g(r, \omega)\) is the correlation function. This entropy is further divided into translational (S\textsubscript{trans}) and orientational (S\textsubscript{or}) components:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{excess}} = S_{\text{trans}} + S_{\text{or}}
\end{equation}
For this notation it is useful to separated the correlation function into a angle independent component and a conditional probability of the angles:
\begin{equation}
    g(r, \omega) = g(r) g(\omega | r)
\end{equation}
Now S\textsubscript{trans} and S\textsubscript{or} are written as follows:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{trans}} = - \frac{1}{2} k_B \rho \int_V [ g(r) ln \,  g(r) - g(r) + 1 ] d \mathbf{r} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
    S_{\text{trans}} = & - \frac{1}{2} k_B \rho \int_0^\pi sin \theta d \theta \int_0^{2\pi} d \phi \int_0^\infty   [ g(r) ln\,  g(r) - g(r) + 1 ] r^2 dr \\
     = &  - {2} \pi k_B \rho \int_0^\infty   [ g(r) ln \,  g(r) - g(r) + 1 ] r^2 dr 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
And the orientation component integrates over all five angles as a conditional probability of pair distance (r). The five angles contain symmetry such that the integration ranges are modified as given in Table \ref{table:ent_angles}.

Where the integrand (\( \int d\omega\)) is:

 \end{split}
\end{equation}
And \(\Omega\) is the integral over all angles:
\begin{equation}
    \Omega = 2\pi \int_0^\pi sin \, \theta_1 d \theta_1 \int_0^\pi sin \, \theta_2 d \theta_2 \int_0^\pi d\phi\int_0^\pi d\chi_1 \int_0^\pi d\chi_2 = 2 \pi * 2 * 2 * \pi * \pi * \pi = 8 \pi^4
\end{equation}
Although the \(2\pi\) before the integrand is ignored because it will cancel with the normalization. For each of the angles, the distribution function is normalized such that:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\Omega} \int g(\omega | r ) \, d \omega = 1  
\end{equation}

\cite{Maniwa2005} 2005, XRD and MD studies of CNTs with varying diameters (10.9 - 15.2 \r A). Found four different structures. 
Also the melting temperature of the ice changed as a function of CNT diameter.

%% BENZENE STUFF

%The benzene parameters were taken from the OPLS-AA force field \cite{Jorgensen1996}.
%The atom type \#145 was used for benzene carbons and \#146 was used for benzene
%hydrogens. This is from the papers: J. Am. Chem. SOC. 1990, 112, 4168-4114 \cite{Jorgensen1990}.
