\section*{Introduction}

The properties and phase behavior of water under nanoconfinement are remarkably different than those in bulk, with important implications for nanotechnological applications and biological processes\cite{Lucent2007, Holt2006, Levinger2002, Nair2012}. Driven by the pursuit to understand the physics underlying the anomalous behavior of water under hydrophobic nanoconfinement, topics such as low-dimensional ice formation \cite{Algara-Siller2015, Koga2001} (which remains controversial \cite{Zhou2015}), unconventional solid-liquid and liquid-liquid phase transitions  \cite{Mochizuki2015,Han2010,Giovambattista2009,Zhu2015}, or hydrophobic evaporation (i.e. liquid-gas phase transitions) \cite{Sharma2012,Altabet2017,Head-Gordon2008,Hummer2001}, have been extensively studied over the last decade. It is important to note that the literature on confined water is vast, and the references cited in this letter are representative, but by no means exhaustive. 

When water is confined under slit nanocapillaries, such as in between graphene sheets, it exhibits strong density fluctuations in the direction of confinement, signature of a layered structure. The surface effect persists to distances of about 5 \r A \cite{Cicero2008,Chialvo2016}, suggesting that configurations of up to three layers of water should be stable under planar confinement. Indeed, multilayered ice phases up to trilayers have been observed \cite{Algara-Siller2015,Satarifard2017}. A requirement to form crystalline arrangements, besides low temperatures or high confinement pressures (in the order of GPa at room temperature \cite{Algara-Siller2015,Satarifard2017}), is that the confinement distance and the amount of water are commensurate, i.e. the density of water is such that individual layers can develop in-plane long-range order \cite{Satarifard2017,Chen2017,Corsetti2016}. When the density is too high or two low, all other control parameters constant, the confinement becomes incommensurate, the water cannot develop long-range in-plane order, and more disordered phases prevail. In the case of a monolayer, before the transition from ice to a liquid phase \cite{Han2010}, a puckered configuration forms \cite{Kaneko2014,Zhu2016}. The solid-liquid phase transition triggered by incommensurability is also observed for other multilayered phases of ice \cite{Zhu2015}. Interestingly, at higher temperatures or lower pressures where liquid phases are more stable, liquid-liquid transitions are also triggered by differences in commensurability. For example, a transition between a bilayer liquid phase and a trilayer heterogeneous fluid, as the density was increased, has been reported \cite{Giovambattista2009}. The heterogeneous liquid consists of a layered structure with relatively highly ordered layers close to the confining surfaces, and a highly disordered intermediate layer. A recent study where oscillations in the shear viscosity of confined water of several orders of magnitude where observed over changes in the confinement distance as small as one \r Angstrom \cite{Neek-Amal2016}, is another example of the significant effect of commensurability in confined systems.

What these studies have in common is the use of rigid confining surfaces, even when graphene in employed. Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope, intrinsically flexible \cite{Wei2013,Fasolino2007}, that due its unique properties \cite{Geim2007} has become a paradigmatic example of hydrophobic confining surface. Only a few studies have considered flexible confining surfaces, and the reported differences with respect to rigid confinement depend on the simulation conditions and system setup: from insignificant effects observed on the structure single-layer square ice formed by a small pocket of water confined between much larger graphene sheets \cite{Algara-Siller2015}, to relatively mild effects on structural and dynamical properties of water confined by multilayered free standing graphene systems \cite{Deshmukh2014}, to changes of many orders of magnitude in the hydrophobic evaporation rate when flexible graphene-like walls clamped at the ends are used \cite{Altabet2017}. Given the complex phase behavior of confined water, and the sensitivity to certain control parameters and system setup, there is a crucial gap in our fundamental understanding of confined water: Does the phase behavior of water mapped under rigid confinement extend to the more realistic conditions of flexible confinement?

Here, we study the phase behavior of confined water under physically accurate flexible graphene sheets using molecular dynamics simulations at constant ambient temperature and pressure. We find that when the system is commensurate, the flexibility of the confining surfaces has only marginal effects on the phase behavior, justifying the use of rigid models to study commensurate configurations, such as ice phases. On the other hand, the flexibility of graphene has a tremendous impact on incommensurate configurations, where the graphene sheets bend to accommodate a novel biphasic layered state, where an n-layer and an (n+1)-layer phase coexist next to each other. This multiphase coexisting state is reminiscent of that observed under inhomogeneous confinement \cite{Qiu2015}, with the important difference that here the inhomogeneity is not enforced, but self-imposed by the system. When the same incommensurate systems are simulated under rigid confinement, disordered liquid phases, similar to the heterogeneous fluid described above, are observed. The biphasic multilayer state under flexible confinement persists across a relatively wide range of confining distances. We observe biphasic states at incommensurate confinement distances where 0 and 1, 1 and 2, and 2 and 3, layered phases coexist. The regions with water in the 0/1 state form ice domains with both rhombic and distorted-square lattices. Remarkably, increasing the temperature of the system can trigger the transition from the biphasic liquid state to the heterogeneous fluid phase. This study provides new comprehensive understanding of the phase behavior of confined water, and sheds light into the role of flexible confinement and its interplay with commensurability effects. Furthermore, our results, based on a realistic model of graphene, will be useful to interpret experimental results in the future, where carbon allotropes are ubiquitously employed.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Models}

For this study, simulations of systems with parallel graphene plates with
separations of 6 and 12 \r A respectively in the x-cartesian dimension.
Systems of two different sizes were used to explore periodic size effects, with graphene
plate separation held constant. The smaller systems had y-z dimensions of 46.2 by 48.5 \r A
and the large systems had dimensions of 121.8 by 118.8 \r A.

\textbf{\color{red} How were they built?? }

\subsection*{Force fields}

Harmonic bond and angle potentials were applied to the graphene sheets with 
the following parameters: k\textsubscript{bond} = 938.0 \(kCal/mol/\angstrom^2\)
and k\textsubscript{angle} = 126.0 \(kCal/mol/rad^2\), equilibrium bond and 
angle lengths of 1.40 \r A and 120.0 degrees respectively \cite{Hummer2001}. The
dihedral potential is harmonic with the functional form: \(E_{\text{di}} = K_{\text{di}} [ 1 + d cos(\phi)]\),
where K\textsubscript{di} = 3.15 kCal/mol, \(\phi = 180.0\) degrees and \(d = \pm 1\) \cite{Patra2009}. An improper torsional 
potential with a harmonic functional form as follows: \( E_{\text{im}} = K_{\text{im}} [ \chi - \chi_0 ]^2\) was
used with parameters K\textsubscript{im} =  15.0 kCal/mol and \(\chi_0 = 0.0\) degrees. A summary
of these potentials and their parameter values are given in Table \ref{table:ff_parms}
The water model chosen is TIP4P-Ew \cite{Horn2004} was used 
to represent explicit solvent. Partial charges and Van der Waals parameters for each atom type 
are given in Table \ref{table:ff_parms_atoms}.

\subsection*{Simulation protocols}

Simulations were performed with the LAMMPS software package \cite{Plimpton1995}. 
Equilibration of initial configurations were performed as follows. Systems were run in 
the NVE ensemble with a Langevin Thermostat at 298 Kelvin
for 10 ps. The water was then fixed with the SHAKE protocol \cite{Andersen1983} with a tolerance
of 10\textsuperscript{-4} and the system was run for 10 ps in the NVT ensemble.
Finally, data was saved for analysis in a production run in the NpT ensemble,
during which all cartesian coordinates were stored every 500 timesteps. 
Systems were run in the NpT ensemble for 10 ns. The 
pressure in the direction orthogonal to the graphene walls was maintained at 1 atm.
Thermal and pressure control were implemented using a Nos\' e-Hoover 
extended Lagrangian procedure \cite{Martyna1994} with characteristic damping times of 100 
and 1000 fs (0.1 and 1.0 ps), respectively. The dynamical integration 
scheme was velocity-Verlet \cite{Swope1982}.
For all simulations, the dynamics timestep was set at 2.0 femtoseconds. 

\subsection*{Analysis}

\subsubsection*{Energy calculations}

The excess Gibbs free energy (G\textsubscript{excess}) of the confined water was calculated as the sum of the excess enthalpy (H\textsubscript{excess}) and the excess entropy (S\textsubscript{excess}) as follows:
\begin{equation}
    G\textsubscript{excess}  =  H_{\text{excess}} - T  S_{\text{excess}}
\end{equation}

Where is H\textsubscript{excess} defined as \textbf{\color{red}this is from \cite{Huggins2012}}. 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\text{excess}} = E_{\text{interaction}} - RT
\end{equation}

Where E\textsubscript{excess} is computed from long-range and pair interactions. Bonded energetics (bond stretching, angle bending) are not included because the water mode is rigid. Calculations of the excess entropy are detailed in the next section and have been taken from the method detailed by Huggins \cite{Huggins2012}.

\subsubsection*{Entropy calculations}

The molecular pair correlation function in water is a function of five angles and the intermolecular separation, as depicted in Figure \textbf{\color{red}OMG figure}. Using the pair correlation function, the excess entropy can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{excess}} = - \frac{1}{2} k_B \rho \int_V [ g(r, \omega) ln \, g(r, \omega) - g(r, \omega) + 1 ] d \mathbf{r} \, d\omega
\end{equation}
Where k\textsubscript{B} is Boltzmann's constant, \(\rho\) is the number density of bulk water and \(g(r, \omega)\) is the correlation function. This entropy is further divided into translational (S\textsubscript{trans}) and orientational (S\textsubscript{or}) components:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{excess}} = S_{\text{trans}} + S_{\text{or}}
\end{equation}
For this notation it is useful to separated the correlation function into a angle independent component and a conditional probability of the angles:
\begin{equation}
    g(r, \omega) = g(r) g(\omega | r)
\end{equation}
Now S\textsubscript{trans} and S\textsubscript{or} are written as follows:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{trans}} = - \frac{1}{2} k_B \rho \int_V [ g(r) ln \,  g(r) - g(r) + 1 ] d \mathbf{r} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
    S_{\text{trans}} = & - \frac{1}{2} k_B \rho \int_0^\pi sin \theta d \theta \int_0^{2\pi} d \phi \int_0^\infty   [ g(r) ln\,  g(r) - g(r) + 1 ] r^2 dr \\
     = &  - {2} \pi k_B \rho \int_0^\infty   [ g(r) ln \,  g(r) - g(r) + 1 ] r^2 dr 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
And the orientation component integrates over all five angles as a conditional probability of pair distance (r). The five angles contain symmetry such that the integration ranges are modified as given in Table \ref{table:ent_angles}.

Where the integrand (\( \int d\omega\)) is:

 \end{split}
\end{equation}
And \(\Omega\) is the integral over all angles:
\begin{equation}
    \Omega = 2\pi \int_0^\pi sin \, \theta_1 d \theta_1 \int_0^\pi sin \, \theta_2 d \theta_2 \int_0^\pi d\phi\int_0^\pi d\chi_1 \int_0^\pi d\chi_2 = 2 \pi * 2 * 2 * \pi * \pi * \pi = 8 \pi^4
\end{equation}
Although the \(2\pi\) before the integrand is ignored because it will cancel with the normalization. For each of the angles, the distribution function is normalized such that:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\Omega} \int g(\omega | r ) \, d \omega = 1  
\end{equation}

Dynamic properties: viscosity, velocity correlation functions, hydrogen bond reorientation

Things that could be varied:

1. The shape of confinement: lamella, cylinders, pores
2. The nature of the confinement: hydrophobic, hydrophilic, charged, uncharged
3. The length scales of confinement: size confiner - pore diameter, lamella separation

\subsection*{Previous studies on confined water:}

1. Water in rigid graphene

2. Water in flexible graphene - used finite graphene sheets, did 

Deshmukh et al (2014) performed classical MD of finite graphene sheets in water boxes.
