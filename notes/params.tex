\section*{Introduction}

Significance: many simulations have been performed with rigid graphene models, but if they are flexible, they may interact with the water in in different ways. \\

The study of water in its many forms has always been an area of great interest for a range of scientific studies. It has been shown that water in a confined environment exhibits structural and dynamic properties significantly differing from those of bulk water. At small confinement distances, water adapts ice-like structures, both in carbon nanotubes (CNT) and lamelllar graphene. In the carbon nanotubes, it has been seen that the ice monolayer mimics the cylindrical nature of the CNT, through x-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) studies \cite{Maniwa2005}. In graphene sheets, ice has been seen in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) \cite{Algara-Siller2015} as well as MD simulations of monolayers and bilayers of water \cite{Zangi2003,Zangi2003_2}. Other structural properties: organization of water near wall, core-shell model (close to wall, water is very structured, further away behaves more like bulk). 

Dynamic properties: viscosity, velocity correlation functions.


The characterization of water in confinement is an exciting field with applications in a variety of domains, including biological applications, microfluidics and electrochemistry. \\

Things that could be varied:

1. The shape of confinement: lamella, cylinders, pores
2. The nature of the confinement: hydrophobic, hydrophilic, charged, uncharged
3. The length scales of confinement: size confiner - pore diameter, lamella separation

Types of studies:

1. Microscopy
2. x-ray diffraction to look at water structure
3. Computation

\subsection*{Previous studies on confined water:}

1. Water in rigid graphene

2. Water in flexible graphene - used finite graphene sheets, did 

Deshmukh et al (2014) performed classical MD of finite graphene sheets in water boxes.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Models}

For this study, simulations of systems with parallel graphene plates with
separations of 6 and 12 \r A respectively in the x-cartesian dimension.
Systems of two different sizes were used to explore periodic size effects, with graphene
plate separation held constant. The smaller systems had y-z dimensions of 46.2 by 48.5 \r A
and the large systems had dimensions of 121.8 by 118.8 \r A.

\textbf{\color{red} How were they built?? }

\subsection*{Force fields}

Harmonic bond and angle potentials were applied to the graphene sheets with 
the following parameters: k\textsubscript{bond} = 938.0 \(kCal/mol/\angstrom^2\)
and k\textsubscript{angle} = 126.0 \(kCal/mol/rad^2\), equilibrium bond and 
angle lengths of 1.40 \r A and 120.0 degrees respectively \cite{Hummer2001}. The
dihedral potential is harmonic with the functional form: \(E_{\text{di}} = K_{\text{di}} [ 1 + d cos(\phi)]\),
where K\textsubscript{di} = 3.15 kCal/mol, \(\phi = 180.0\) degrees and \(d = \pm 1\) \cite{Patra2009}. An improper torsional 
potential with a harmonic functional form as follows: \( E_{\text{im}} = K_{\text{im}} [ \chi - \chi_0 ]^2\) was
used with parameters K\textsubscript{im} =  15.0 kCal/mol and \(\chi_0 = 0.0\) degrees. A summary
of these potentials and their parameter values are given in Table \ref{table:ff_parms}
The water model chosen is TIP4P-Ew \cite{Horn2004} was used 
to represent explicit solvent. Partial charges and Van deWaals parameters for each atom type 
are given in Table \ref{table:ff_parms_atoms}.

\subsection*{Simulation protocols}

Simulations were performed with the LAMMPS software package \cite{Plimpton1995}. 
Equilibration of initial configurations were performed as follows. Systems were run in 
the NVE ensemble with a Langevin Thermostat at 298 Kelvin
for 10 ps. The water was then fixed with the SHAKE protocol \cite{Andersen1983} with a tolerance
of 10\textsuperscript{-5}, and the system was run for 10 ps in the NVT ensemble.
Finally, data was saved for analysis in a production run in the NpT ensemble,
during which all cartesian coordinates were stored every 500 timesteps. 
Systems were run in the NpT ensemble for 10 ns. The 
pressure in the direction orthogonal to the graphene walls was maintained at 1 atm.
Thermal control was implemented using a Nos\' e-Hoover extended Lagrangian procedure \cite{Martyna1994},
and the dynamical integration scheme was velocity-Verlet \cite{Swope1982}.
For all simulations, the dynamics timestep was set at 2.0 femtoseconds.
