abstract = "Distinctive from their 1D and 0D counterparts, 2D nanomaterials (2DNs) exhibit surface corrugations (wrinkles and ripples) and crumples. Thermal vibrations, edge instabilities, thermodynamically unstable (interatomic) interactions, strain in 2D crystals, thermal contraction, dislocations, solvent trapping, pre-strained substrate-relaxation, surface anchorage and high solvent surface tension during transfer cause wrinkles or ripples to form on graphene. These corrugations on graphene can modify its electronic structure, create polarized carrier puddles, induce pseudomagnetic field in bilayers and alter surface properties. This review outlines the different mechanisms of wrinkle, ripple and crumple formation, and the interplay between wrinklesâ and ripplesâ attributes (wavelength/width, amplitude/height, length/size, and bending radius) and graphene's electronic properties and other mechanical, optical, surface, and chemical properties. Also included are brief discussions on corrugation-induced reversible wettability and transmittance in graphene, modulation of its chemical potential, enhanced energy storage and strain sensing via relaxation of corrugations. Finally, the review summarizes the future areas of research for 2D corrugations and crumples. "

abstract  ="Classical molecular dynamics simulations are used to present a detailed atomistic picture of the instantaneous local structures of water and the structural evolution of stationary and dynamically evolving graphene-water interfaces. The confinement effects are strongly coupled to the nature of the interface{,} which eventually governs its nanoscopic structural arrangements and interface dynamics. We show that the structure{,} transport properties{,} and vibrational densities of states of proximal water molecules are strongly correlated with the nature of the graphene-water interface. We identify and correlate features in vibrational spectra with characteristic structural features observed at the atomic scale for the confined water molecules near a stationary and dynamically evolving hydrophobic surface such as graphene. Our simulations indicate that the local orientation{,} ordering{,} and solvation dynamics of interfacial water molecules are a strong function of the graphene slit-width{,} which is controlled by the nature of the interface (fully flexible vs. static). A monotonic decrease in local ordering with increasing slit-width was observed for the static graphene-water interface{,} whereas a non-monotonic variation was seen for its fully flexible counterpart. The simulation results offer useful insights into the effect of interfacial dynamics in defining the structure and transport properties at graphene-aqueous media interfaces. Finally these simulations provide a molecular level interpretation of the differential confinement effects arising from the dynamically evolving graphene-water interface."}

@article{Huggins2012,
abstract = {Water is one of simplest molecules in existence, but also one of the most important in biological and engineered systems. However, understanding the structure and dynamics of liquid water remains a major scientific challenge. Molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water were performed using the water models TIP3P-Ewald, TIP4P-2005, TIP5P-Ewald and SWM4-NDP to calculate the radial distribution functions, the relative angular distributions and the excess enthalpies, entropies and free energies. In addition, lower-order approximations to the entropy were considered, identifying the fourth-order approximation as an excellent estimate of the full entropy. The second-order and third-order approximations are approximately 20{\%} larger and smaller than the true entropy respectively. All four models perform very well in predicting the radial distribution functions, with the TIP5P-Ewald model providing the best match to the experimental data. The models also perform well in predicting the excess entropy, enthalpy and free energy of liquid water. The TIP4P-2005 and SWM4-NDP models are more accurate than the TIP3P-Ewald and TIP5P-Ewald models in this respect. However, the relative angular distribution functions of the four water models reveal notable differences. The TIP5P-Ewald model demonstrates an increased preference for water molecules to act both as tetrahedral hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, whereas the SWM4-NDP model demonstrates an increased preference for water molecules to act as planar hydrogen bond acceptors. These differences are not uncovered by analysis of the RDFs or the commonly employed tetrahedral order parameter. However, they are expected to be very important when considering water molecules around solutes and are thus a key consideration in modelling solvent entropy.},

abstract = {Diffusion across surfaces generally involves motion on a vibrating but otherwise stationary substrate. Here, using molecular dynamics, we show that a layered material such as graphene opens up a new mechanism for surface diffusion whereby adsorbates are carried by propagating ripples in a motion similar to surfing. For water nanodroplets, we demonstrate that the mechanism leads to exceedingly fast diffusion that is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the self-diffusion of water molecules in liquid water. We also reveal the underlying principles that regulate this new mechanism for diffusion and show how it also applies to adsorbates other than water, thus opening up the prospect of achieving fast and controllable motion of adsorbates across material surfaces more generally.},

Once the nanodroplets are deposited at selected spots on the planar nanostructure, they can act as catalytic elements that initiate conformational changes and help to overcome deformation barriers associated with them. Nanodroplets can induce rapid bending, folding, sliding, rolling, and zipping of the planar nanostructures, which can lead to the assembly of nanoscale sandwiches, capsules, knots, and rings. }}
