abstract = "We report on a systematic X-ray diffraction analysis for the ordered water inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with diameters of 10.9–15.2 Å. Four distinct ordered structures identified in this diameter range were assigned to polygonal ice-nanotubes predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. The ordering transition temperature rose from 190 K of octagonal ice-nanotubes to 300 K of pentagonal ice-nanotubes without applying high pressure when the \{SWNT\} diameter decreased. The results indicate a crossover from bulk to atomic scale phenomena with decreasing \{SWNT\} diameter. "

abstract = { We demonstrate by molecular dynamics simulations that water nanodroplets can activate and guide the folding of planar graphene nanostructures. Once the nanodroplets are deposited at selected spots on the planar nanostructure, they can act as catalytic elements that initiate conformational changes and help to overcome deformation barriers associated with them. Nanodroplets can induce rapid bending, folding, sliding, rolling, and zipping of the planar nanostructures, which can lead to the assembly of nanoscale sandwiches, capsules, knots, and rings. }}
